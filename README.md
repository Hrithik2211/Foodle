# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Procedure for development of app:
This application is built using React.js and Axios to fetch food product data from the OpenFoodFacts API. It allows users to search, filter, and sort products, with a detailed view for each item.
Features:
- Home Page Display
  Displays a list of food products fetched from the OpenFoodFacts API, showing product images and names.

- Search Functionality
  Users can search for products by name, with results dynamically updated on the home page.

- Category Filter
  Users can filter products based on categories like "Snacks", "Drinks", and "Cakes" through a dropdown.

- Sorting Options
  The app allows sorting products by name (A-Z, Z-A) and nutrition grade (ascending/descending).

- Pagination
  The home page displays a limited number of products per view, with navigation options for the next and previous pages.

- Product Detail Page
  Clicking a product leads to a detailed page with its image, ingredients, and nutritional information.

- Responsive Design
  Tailwind CSS ensures the app is fully responsive, with a clean layout for both mobile and desktop screens.

- Equal-Sized Product Cards
  Products are displayed in a grid of three per row, with evenly spaced and dimensioned cards.

- Efficient API Handling
  Axios is used for all API requests, ensuring smooth data fetching and error handling.

- Interactive UI
  Hover effects and transition animations improve user interaction, making the app more engaging.

# Time for completion:
  After reading the documentation on 22nd September 2024 it took 3 days to complete the app and deploy for production build.
